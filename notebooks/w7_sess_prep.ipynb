    "### How the code works\n",
    "The code prompts the user to enter the name of a CSV file. It then opens the file using the open function and creates a csv.reader object from the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "A LineHolder object is created to hold the rows of the CSV file. The code then iterates over each row in the CSV file, parses the row using the parse_line method of the LineHolder object, and prints each row for debugging purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the code prints all lines in the LineHolder object by iterating over its lines attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Expanding the code\n",
    "Students can expand this code to perform various tasks on the CSV file. Here are some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Filtering rows based on a condition: Students can add a method to the LineHolder class to filter rows based on a condition. For example, they could filter out rows that do not meet a certain criteria, or extract rows that contain certain keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computing statistics: Students can add a method to the LineHolder class to compute statistics on the CSV file. For example, they could compute the mean or median of a certain column, or count the number of rows that meet a certain criteria.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Writing to a new file: Students can modify the code to write the contents of the LineHolder object to a new CSV file. They can use the csv.writer class to write rows to the new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using command-line arguments: Students can modify the code to take the name of the CSV file as a command-line argument, rather than prompting the user to enter it. They can use the argparse module to parse command-line arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Handling different types of delimiters: By default, the csv.reader class assumes that CSV files are comma-separated. However, students can modify the code to handle different types of delimiters, such as tab-separated or pipe-separated values. They can use the csv.Dialect class to define a new dialect for the CSV file.\n",
